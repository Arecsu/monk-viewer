-----------

model-viewer (https://modelviewer.dev/) is nice. 
But there are performance and feature implications.
Let's grab three.js and see what we can do.

Welcome monk-viewer!

Cool features:
- Offscreen Canvas + Web Workers! No more jank in the main thread. 
- Because of it, your beautiful JS slider will work, buttery smooth (assured 99%).
- Auto-detection of device power in the first 500ms
- Will scale down the resolution and enable/disable MSAA as needed
- Worker can dispatch events to the DOM elements
- Total control of Three.js pipeline
- Adobe Gain Map (Ultra HDR) JPG environment maps compatible

Me, I've learned so far:
- More about three.js
- Vite + compile browser modules
- More about 3D graphics in general

Also:
- Submitted two improvements to threejs + @monogrid/gainmap-js1
